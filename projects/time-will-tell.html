            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>During this project, I created a movie webpage with a partner in replit. We used our skills learned from SEP to create a website.
            We were able to use HMTL and CSS to design our website and create an advertisement for a make-belief movie.</p>
            <p>We decided to create a movie webpage that is more relatable to our lives but with a spice of creativity. We included time travel into the story
             and when coding, we decided to seperate the work evenly throughout the project. I worked on the text and the formatting of the text, while my 
            partner worked on designing the website, which includes color and borders. </p>
            <p>A struggle me and my partner had was collaboration. It was difficult planning what our movie webpage was going to be about so I decided to
            take initiative and put down an idea. We were then able to communicate to how we wanted to work out our website. Creating this website has helped
            me understand how to code the most as it has taken what we have learnt previously and use it in our own work. I think that working on something
            myself in code is the easiest way for me to learn. I also thought it was a create way to express creativity, especially using code. Figuring out
                colors and designs while talking to my partner really helped in communication skills. Needing to say what I am deciding to add to the website is 
                important so we can both know how the website will turn out. Overall, I thought it was really fun and I am looking forward to creating more websites
                using CSS and HTML after I have learned new topics.
