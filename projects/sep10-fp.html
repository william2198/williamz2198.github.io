            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>The freedom project was the year-long project that I worked on about the Technologies in Animation. The website was organized into a heading, 2d animation inventions, 3d animation inventions, hardware and new inventions that I have come up with. The website was made from scratch without a template and I used bootstrap and the tool, Animate.CSS,
            to design my website. The bootstrap components I used were the navbar and the collapse, where I used on the new inventions. When creating the website, I had to make sure it was the MVP (minimum valuable product) so the website works before I add any additional features. In the end, I think my website did a great job at conveying the purpose of my project.</p>
            <p>The freedom project I worked on was about Animation. In the context, it included information about the transformation of animation from cel animation to 2d animation to 3d animation. This part makes were the reader understands the background information of the topic so they understand the rest of the website better.
            When creating my website, I first put the layout of my website such as my navbar, heading, and content so everything is inputted correctly. I had struggled on placing a specific div in the current technology section and making sure it match the layout I wanted. After asking for some help, I successfully created what I wanted by adding a div around 2D animation and hardware and making them a column.</p>
